# Project rules

- Use `bun` for installing packages and running scripts.
- Keep content in `src/content/{blog,projects,tldrs}` with frontmatter fields defined in `src/content/config.ts`.
- Use React islands only for interactive UI (filters, skill paths, contact form).
- Prefer Astro components for layout and static cards; keep client JS minimal.
- Read data from YAML files in `src/data` for skill paths and accomplishments.
- Fetch GitHub milestone progress at build time and cache in `.cache/github.json`.
- Store global UI styles in `src/styles/global.css` and keep components simple.

# Memory
- When you find a piece of information that is important to the project (A critical fix that should be kept in mind later), add it to `.cursor/rules/memory.mdc`.
- Keep memories as a list, and keep them short and sweet.
